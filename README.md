# CV Application

The main intent for this project was to practice getting used to React and the `useState` hook. The resume format provided is heavily inspired by [Jake's resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) and as such is mainly geared towards individuals in the tech field.
